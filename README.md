# UtilMonitor
Project started over summer of 2020. Uses multiple libraries including Open Hardware Monitor to get real time load on the user's PC.

## Objective
Create a simple, easy to use monitor for hardware without requiring too deep an understanding of hardware which can then also send external notifications to notify a user as to which aspect of their system maxed out.
